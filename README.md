# CoffeeBot
CoffeeBot is created using AWS Lex and the Serverless Framework


Current Menu : 
 types = ['latte', 'americano', 'cappuccino', 'expresso'];
 sizes = ['double', 'normal', 'large'];

Bot checks AWS Dynamo DB to see your previous order and reccomends it back to you.

Further Revisions will include Initializing Bot with Menu and expanding Menu too.
